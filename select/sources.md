https://htmlreference.io/element/select/
  Super barebones source, useful if you already know
  a lot about the element, but need something to jog
  your memory so you don't have to parse a lot of text
  
http://www.htmlref.com/reference/appa/tag_select.htm
  Good reference, but its for HTML4 so it's a bit out
  of date, double check before using

https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp
  Similar to htmlreference.io but goes into a bit more
  depth. It's easy to process for beginners, but not a
  great final source

https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#the-select-element
  Excellent primary source, but super in the weeds with
  details, bad for a quick google search

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-select-element
  Very similar to w3.org, but truthfully I think w3 is
  a little prettier and easier to read. But similar pros/cons

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select
  A solid middle ground between the spec and w3schools. Accurate
  and goes into a good amount of detail without being too overbearing.
  I wouldn't use it as a primary source though.
